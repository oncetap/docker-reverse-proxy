# Setup
## Optional
If `network_mode: host` is too invasive or not possible, comment the entire line to disable it. The downside for this is that the stats for `Bandwidth` will stop working. This issue doesn't have a known workaround. See henrygd/beszel#27

## Beszel Hub
Put `/beszel_socket/beszel.sock` on the `Host / IP` field on the `Add a System` menu.
