# Setup
## Optional
If you want to enable network monitoring (Bandwidth section), uncomment `network_mode: host` and comment the entire networks field. This issue doesn't have a known workaround. See henrygd/beszel#27

## Beszel Hub
Put `/beszel_socket/beszel.sock` on the `Host / IP` field on the `Add a System` menu.
